# r-statistics-foundations
A comprehensive 10-day intensive curriculum on Statistics and R for Biological Sciences. Covers data wrangling, probability distributions, hypothesis testing (t-test, ANOVA), and linear regression


# Foundations of Statistics & R for Biologists 

This repository documents an intensive 10-day curriculum designed to build a professional foundation in Data Science and Statistical Inference using R. 

## Course Syllabus

### Week 1: Core Fundamentals & Exploration
* **Day 1-2:** R Environment, Data Structures (Vectors, DataFrames), and I/O (CSV/Excel).
* **Day 3-4:** Descriptive Statistics (SD, IQR) and the Grammar of Graphics with `ggplot2`.
* **Day 5:** Probability & Simulations (Normal distribution, Z-scores, and `pnorm`/`qnorm`).

### Week 2: Inferential Statistics & Modeling
* **Day 6:** Central Limit Theorem (CLT) simulations and Sampling Theory.
* **Day 7:** Hypothesis Testing: Single, Independent, and Paired T-tests.
* **Day 8:** Categorical Analysis (Chi-square) and Variance Analysis (**ANOVA** with Tukey Post-hoc).
* **Day 9:** Correlation (Pearson/Spearman) and **Linear Regression** modeling.

## Capstone Project
The final day focuses on an end-to-end biological analysis:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Factorizing treatments and handling missing values.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Running ANOVA to determine treatment efficacy.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Building multiple linear regression models to predict plant weight based on height and leaf count.

##  Skills Demonstrated
* **Statistical Tests:** t-test, ANOVA, Chi-square, Tukey HSD.
* **Modeling:** Linear Regression (`lm`).
* **Visualization:** `ggplot2` (Boxplots, Histograms, Scatter plots).
* **Simulations:** `replicate()`, `rnorm()`, `rchisq()`.
